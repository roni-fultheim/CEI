## üß¨ Overview

This project offers:
- A cloud-native computing platform built with Nextflow, Docker, and GCP/AWS for high-throughput RNA editing analysis
- Resources for quantifying both the **cytoplasmic editing index** and **global Alu editing index**
- Reproducible workflows for the analysis presented in the paper
- Example datasets and configurations for running your own analysis

## üìÅ Repository Structure
CEI provides:

- A scalable cloud-native workflow for computing:
  - The **Cytoplasmic Editing Index (CEI)**  
  - The **Global Alu Editing Index (AEI)**
  - Editing within [known editing sites](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28841-4)
  - Gene expression
- Infrastructure support for:
  - **GCP and AWS**
  - Parallelized processing of **SRA** and **TCGA** samples
- Full analysis and plotting scripts for:
  - Benchmarking CEI vs global index
  - Immune-related editing response
  - Orientation-aware Alu element analysis
